		"price": "Brown noise, also known as Brownian noise, is a type of sound signal that has a deeper, more bass-heavy tone compared to white noise. It is created by emphasizing lower frequencies, resulting in a richer, smoother sound that resembles the rumbling of distant thunder or the sound of a waterfall. Brown noise has several benefits, particularly for relaxation and sleep. Its low-frequency tones have been shown to promote relaxation by creating a soothing and calming atmosphere, making it ideal for those who struggle with anxiety or stress. Additionally, brown noise is effective in masking disruptive background sounds, which can help individuals concentrate or fall asleep more easily. For those who find white noise too sharp or high-pitched, brown noise offers a more pleasant alternative, promoting restful sleep, reducing stress, and improving focus.",
